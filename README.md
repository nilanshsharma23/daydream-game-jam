# Prometheia

This is a game that was made in about 20 hours for the Hackclub Daydream Game Jam.

According to Greek Mythology, Prometheus was a titan who made a great sacrifice. He was punished for stealing fire from the gods, which allowed humanity to flourish. Our game focuses on making sacrifices in order to reach an end goal. You have to give up parts of your body as a robot in order to progress and reach the end.
